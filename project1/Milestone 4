Everything about this project went well for me. I got very close to what I initially wanted the app to look like 
and it came out to be very similar to it. It was alot of fun working with custom tableview class and it was 
painful working with bunch of delegate methods, especially the search bar delegates took quite a bit to make 
it what I wanted it to look like. 
The only thing I want to add for the future is the data presistence part. I was trying very hard to add this 
but I had so many problems trying to add an image into the Realm database. I will definetly add. I have been trying
to look into more ways to add images and I was trying to save just the file destination but that did not work out.
I have been looking into converting the image to base64 string.
